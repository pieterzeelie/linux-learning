# Introduction to Linux

Linux is a free, open-source operating system based on UNIX. It is widely used for servers, desktops, embedded systems, and supercomputers due to its **security, stability, and flexibility**. A Linux system is typically distributed as a **Linux distribution (distro)**, which combines the Linux kernel with supporting libraries, utilities, and applications.

## 📘 History
- Originated from UNIX (developed in the 1970s at AT&T Bell Labs).
- Created by **Linus Torvalds in 1991** as a kernel project.
- Expanded into full operating systems through community-driven distributions.
- Today, there are **600+ distros**, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Linux Mint, and Arch Linux.

## 🔹 Why Use Linux?
- **Free & open-source** → customizable and community-driven.
- **Secure & stable** → strong against malware, rarely needs rebooting.
- **Efficient performance** → ideal for servers and development.
- **Community support** → frequent updates and extensive documentation.

---

## 🏗️ Linux Architecture
- **Kernel**: Core managing hardware and processes.
- **System Libraries**: Pre-written code for apps to interact with the kernel.
- **Shell**: Command-line interface for user interaction.
- **Hardware Layer**: Physical components (CPU, RAM, I/O).
- **System Utilities**: Tools for configuration, monitoring, and administration.

---

## ⚙️ Common Uses
- **Servers & Hosting**: Web, cloud, databases.
- **Development**: Coding, debugging, testing.
- **Cybersecurity**: Ethical hacking, penetration testing.
- **Embedded Systems**: Routers, IoT devices.
- **Supercomputers**: Scientific research.
- **Education**: Teaching programming/system administration.

## 💻 Installation & Software
- Install via bootable USB using ISO images (Ubuntu, Fedora, Mint).
- Package managers: `apt` (Debian/Ubuntu), `dnf` (Fedora).
- GUI software centers also available.

---

## ✅ Advantages
- Open-source, secure, stable, frequent updates, free to use.

## ⚠️ Disadvantages
- Less user-friendly for beginners.
- Limited hardware driver support compared to Windows.

---

## 📝 Basic Commands
- `ls` → list files  
- `cd` → change directory  
- `pwd` → show current path  
- `cp`, `mv`, `rm` → copy, move, delete files  
- `free`, `df`, `top` → monitor memory, disk, processes  
- `ping`, `ifconfig`, `netstat` → network troubleshooting
